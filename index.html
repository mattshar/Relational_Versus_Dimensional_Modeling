    <h1>Relational Data Modeling</h1>

    <h3>Rules and Applications</h3>
    <p>
        Relational data modeling is the backbone of most <strong>OLTP</strong> environments.
        These systems are designed to handle a large number of short, atomic transactions
        such as inserts, updates, and deletes. Examples include e-commerce platforms,
        banking systems, and operational business applications.
    </p>

    <p>
        The primary goal of an OLTP database is to ensure <strong>accuracy, consistency,
        and reliability</strong> of data. To achieve this, relational models follow
        strict normalization rules that minimize redundancy and enforce relationships
        through primary and foreign keys.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        In OLTP systems, correctness is more important than query speed for large scans.
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Benefits of OLTP & Relational Modeling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>High data integrity:</strong> Normalization ensures a single source of truth.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficient writes:</strong> Optimized for frequent inserts and updates.</li>
        <li><strong>Strong consistency:</strong> ACID properties protect transactional reliability.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability for operations:</strong> Handles thousands of concurrent users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tradeoffs and Disadvantages</h3>
    <p>
        While normalization protects data integrity, it introduces complexity when querying
        large datasets. Analytical questions often require joining many tables together,
        which can become expensive as data volume grows.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a result, OLTP databases are not well suited for historical analysis, reporting,
        or aggregations across long time ranges.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Complex queries:</strong> Reporting may require 10–30+ joins.</li>
        <li><strong>Slower analytics:</strong> Large scans and aggregations perform poorly.</li>
        <li><strong>Not analyst-friendly:</strong> Schema complexity increases cognitive load.</li>
    </ul>

            <section class="topic">
    <h1>Dimensional Data Modeling</h1>
    <p>
        Dimensional modeling is built for speed and clarity in <strong>OLAP</strong> environments.
        Think about reports like <em>"Which products sell best on Tuesdays?"</em>
        This is where dimensional schemas truly shine.
    </p>

    <div class="glossary-box">
        <h3>Expanding Our Vocabulary</h3>
        <p>Let us add a couple of more terms to our vocabulary:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>OLAP:</strong> Online Analytical Processing (utilized mainly for historical
                data and business intelligence).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Star Schema:</strong> A denormalized schema used for modeling data through
                facts, surrounded by dimensions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Snowflake Schema:</strong> A more normalized version of the star schema,
                but still surrounds the fact table with its respective dimensions.
            </li>

            <li>
        <strong>Fact Tables:</strong>
        Fact tables store quantitative measurements—such as sales amount, quantity sold,
        or revenue—at a clearly defined level of detail known as the <em>grain</em>.
        These tables typically contain foreign keys that link to related dimension tables.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Dimension Tables: </strong>
        Dimension tables provide descriptive context for facts. They contain attributes
        like product name, customer region, or date, which allow analysts to filter,
        group, and drill into metrics.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Grain:</strong>
        The grain defines what a single row in the fact table represents—for example,
        one row per product sold per day. Establishing the grain early is critical,
        as it determines how the data can be analyzed.
    </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Core Components of a Dimensional Model</h3>
<p>
    At its core, dimensional modeling organizes data in a way that mirrors how
    business users think about their data. Rather than optimizing for transactions,
    it optimizes for readability, performance, and analytical flexibility.
</p>


<h3>Benefits of Dimensional Modeling</h3>
<p>
    Dimensional models are intentionally denormalized to reduce query complexity
    and improve performance for analytical workloads. Generally, we are willing make the sacrifice of having more data redundancy, for the benefit of having fewer tables in this type of environment.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Fast query performance:</strong> Fewer joins and optimized schemas
        allow databases to scan and aggregate large datasets efficiently.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Simple and intuitive design:</strong> Analysts can easily understand
        how facts relate to dimensions, reducing onboarding time.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Business-friendly analytics:</strong> Supports slicing, dicing,
        filtering, and trending across time and other dimensions.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Tradeoffs and Limitations</h3>
<p>
    While dimensional modeling excels in analytical scenarios, it comes with
    tradeoffs that make it unsuitable for transactional workloads.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Data redundancy:</strong> Denormalization leads to repeated values
        across dimension tables, increasing storage requirements. It's a good thing that storage is cheaper than it used to be.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>ETL complexity:</strong> Data must be carefully transformed and loaded
        to ensure consistency across facts and dimensions.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Not ideal for OLTP:</strong> Frequent updates and deletes can be
        expensive and are better handled by normalized relational systems.
    </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    Dimensional modeling trades strict normalization for analytical speed,
    clarity, and usability.
</blockquote>

<h1> Final Thoughts </h1>
<p> Both modeling types have their benefits and environments where they shine, and both are pivotal to many organizations in the current state of technology! </p>
<p> I hope you have learned a bit about both the OLTP and OLAP environments, I encourage you to continue learning about the differences between OLTP and OLAP and how they serve vastly different and important mechanisms of data and analytics! </p>
