            <h2>Hi, I'm Matthew 👋</h2>
            <p>My name is Matthew. I like to write code for various tasks, and teach others along the way. In my free time, I enjoy taking my two-year-old Australian Shepherd for walks, lifting weights with my friends, grabbing coffee, and meeting new people!</p>
            <p>I wanted to write this article to highlight the differences between relational and dimensional data modeling—specifically the benefits, tradeoffs, and applications of both.</p>

                <h3>Key Terms to Know</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Database:</strong> Organized collection of structured information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Table:</strong> An entity holding columns split into rows.</li>
                    <li><strong>Primary Key:</strong> A unique identifier (Integer or GUID) for each row.</li>
                    <li><strong>Foreign Key:</strong> A column that references another table's primary key.</li>
                    <li><strong>OLTP:</strong> Online Transaction Processing (Day-to-day operations).</li>
                    <li><strong>Joins:</strong> Querying information from two or more tables simultaneously.</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Relational Data Modeling</h1>
                <h3>Rules and Applications</h3>
                <p>Relational modeling shines in <strong>OLTP</strong> environments. The goal is to reduce <strong>data redundancy</strong> and maintain <strong>data integrity</strong> through normalization.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    Without proper design, a database is unlikely to scale well within a production environment.
                </blockquote>

                <h3>Tradeoffs and Disadvantages</h3>
                <p>High normalization leads to an increased number of tables. While this protects integrity, it can make queries complex—sometimes requiring 30+ joins—which can degrade performance for analysts.</p>

                <h1>Dimensional Data Modeling</h1>
                <p>Dimensional modeling is built for speed and clarity in <strong>OLAP</strong> environments. Think about reports like "Which products sell best on Tuesdays?" This is where the Star Schema comes into play.</p>
